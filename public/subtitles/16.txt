AI also makes test execution smarter. Instead of running all tests every time, AI identifies which tests are relevant to your changes and runs those first. It detects flaky tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail, helping you fix unreliable tests. When tests fail, AI analyzes the failures and suggests probable causes. It even tracks testing trends over time, helping you identify areas where quality is improving or declining. This intelligence transforms testing from a manual chore into an automated quality assurance system.
