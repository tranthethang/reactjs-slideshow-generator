Now let's talk about the most visible use of AI in development - code generation. GitHub Copilot is probably the most popular tool for this. You write a comment describing what you want, and it generates the code. But it's smarter than simple templates. It understands your project context, follows your coding style, and even suggests better approaches than what you might have planned. I use it every day now. It's especially helpful for boilerplate code, API integrations, and implementing common patterns. The key is learning how to write good prompts - the better you describe what you want, the better code you get.
