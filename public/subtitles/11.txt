AI is excellent at spotting bugs before they reach production. It recognizes common bug patterns and suggests fixes. For instance, it might catch null pointer exceptions, memory leaks, or race conditions. It also suggests refactoring opportunities - like extracting repeated code into functions or suggesting better design patterns. What's really impressive is that AI learns from the entire codebase, so it maintains consistency with existing patterns. I've had AI catch bugs that would have taken hours to debug later. It's like having a senior developer constantly reviewing your code.
