AI also helps us turn vague requirements into clear, actionable user stories. Let's say a client says 'Users should be able to log in.' That's pretty vague, right? AI can automatically generate clarifying questions like: 'Should users log in with email or username? Do you need social login options? How long should sessions last?' Then it converts the final requirement into proper user stories with acceptance criteria. This used to take me hours of back-and-forth emails with clients. Now it happens in minutes, and the quality is actually better because AI remembers to ask about edge cases that I might forget.
