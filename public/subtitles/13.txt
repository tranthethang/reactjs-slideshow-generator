I'll demo building a 'Food Recipe Suggestion API' using AI assistance. This API takes a list of ingredients like pork, potato, onion, sends a request to Gemini API, and returns suitable recipes. Just by describing the idea in comments, AI generates complete Flask API structure, input validation and error handling, Gemini API integration, and basic tests. Work that usually takes a full day now only takes 20 minutes. The code isn't perfect, but it follows best practices and is ready to deploy. Now I'll pause the slideshow and show you these steps live.
