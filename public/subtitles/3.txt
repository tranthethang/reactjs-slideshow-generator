Let's start with why we need AI in development. We all face these challenges every day. Requirements from clients are often unclear or keep changing. We spend hours debugging code and reviewing each other's work. Writing documentation is tedious but necessary. These aren't new problems, but AI gives us new ways to handle them. AI can help us understand requirements better, catch bugs earlier, generate documentation automatically, and make code reviews more efficient. The goal isn't to replace our thinking - it's to handle the repetitive stuff so we can focus on the creative problem-solving that we actually enjoy.
