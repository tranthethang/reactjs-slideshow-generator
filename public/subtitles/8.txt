AI also optimizes project timelines. It identifies which tasks can run in parallel, suggests the best sequence for development, and even flags potential bottlenecks. For instance, it might suggest starting API design early so frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously. Or it might warn that integrating with a third-party payment system could cause delays, so we should start that early. This kind of planning used to require experienced project managers. Now AI gives every developer access to this kind of strategic thinking.
