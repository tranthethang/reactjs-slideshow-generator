Let's start with requirements gathering. Usually, we get requirements in messy formats - long emails, PDF documents, meeting notes. AI can process all this text and extract the actual requirements. For example, I can upload a 10-page requirements document, and AI will identify all the functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and even spot potential conflicts. It saves hours of manual reading and note-taking. The AI doesn't just copy text - it understands context and organizes information logically. This gives us a much cleaner starting point for our projects.
