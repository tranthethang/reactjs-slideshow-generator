Here are some best practices I've learned from using AI coding tools. First, always review AI-generated code carefully. Just because it compiles doesn't mean it's correct. Provide clear context in your comments - the better you explain what you want, the better results you get. Use AI suggestions as a starting point, not the final answer. Test everything thoroughly - AI can miss edge cases. And don't forget to understand the code AI generates. You'll need to maintain it later. The biggest mistake I see is people becoming too dependent on AI and losing their fundamental coding skills. AI should enhance your abilities, not replace them.
