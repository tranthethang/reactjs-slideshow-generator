Here's what we'll cover today. First, we'll talk about why AI matters in software development right now. Then we'll walk through each phase of the software development lifecycle and see exactly how AI tools can help. I'll show you real examples and demos. After that, we'll discuss what I've learned from actually using these tools in projects. Finally, we'll talk about how you can start using AI in your own work. The whole session should take about 40 minutes, with time for questions at the end.
