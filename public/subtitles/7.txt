Once we have clear requirements, AI helps break them down into manageable tasks. You give it a high-level feature, and it creates a complete breakdown structure. For example, 'User Management' becomes registration, login, profile management, password reset, and so on. Each of these gets broken down further into specific development tasks. AI also estimates how complex each task is and identifies dependencies. It's like having an experienced project manager helping you plan. I've found that AI-generated breakdowns are often more thorough than what I would create manually, especially for features outside my main expertise.
