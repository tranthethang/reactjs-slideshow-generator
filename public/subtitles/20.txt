So how do you get started? First, pick one AI tool and one specific use case. I recommend starting with Claude or GitHub Copilot for code generation - it's easy to learn and immediately useful. Try it on a small, non-critical project first. Spend time learning how to write good prompts. Track your results - measure how much time you save, how many bugs AI catches, things like that. Once you're comfortable with one tool, gradually add others. Remember, the goal isn't to use AI everywhere - it's to use AI where it adds the most value. And always maintain your fundamental development skills. AI is a powerful assistant, but you're still the developer making the important decisions.
