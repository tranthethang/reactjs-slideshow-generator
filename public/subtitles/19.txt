Here's what implementing AI tools actually looks like. It's not instant productivity gains - there's usually a 2-4 week learning period where productivity might actually decrease as people learn new workflows. Some team members adapt quickly, others need more time. You need to establish guidelines for when and how to use AI tools. The most successful implementations start small - pick one tool and one use case, learn it well, then expand. Don't try to adopt everything at once. Also, invest time in training - the teams that spend time learning how to use AI tools effectively see much better results.
