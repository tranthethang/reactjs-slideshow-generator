Let's be honest about both the benefits and challenges of AI-assisted development. The benefits are real - faster development, fewer bugs, better documentation, and more consistent code quality. Teams report 30-40% productivity improvements. But there are challenges too. AI suggestions aren't always correct, so you need strong review processes. There's a learning curve for the tools. And there's a risk of becoming too dependent on AI and losing fundamental skills. The key is finding the right balance - using AI to handle routine tasks while maintaining your core development abilities.
