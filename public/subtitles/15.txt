AI also generates comprehensive test suites. Given a function, it creates unit tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. It generates integration tests for APIs and even UI tests for web applications. What's impressive is that AI often thinks of test cases that I would miss. It considers boundary values, null inputs, and unusual scenarios. I used to struggle with writing enough tests - now AI generates a comprehensive test suite, and I just review and customize it. Test coverage has improved dramatically on my projects.
