AI also revolutionizes code review. Traditional code review focuses on style and obvious bugs. AI code review goes much deeper. It catches security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and suggests better algorithms. For example, it might spot a SQL injection vulnerability that human reviewers miss, or suggest using a more efficient data structure. It also ensures consistency across the team - everyone gets feedback based on the same standards. This doesn't replace human code review, but it handles the technical stuff so human reviewers can focus on business logic and architecture decisions.
