Security is where AI really shines. It scans code for vulnerabilities in real-time as you write it. It catches common issues like XSS vulnerabilities, weak authentication, and insecure data handling. But it goes beyond that - it also scans your dependencies for known vulnerabilities and suggests secure alternatives. The best part is that it explains why something is a security risk and how to fix it. This is incredibly valuable for teams that don't have dedicated security experts. AI essentially gives every developer security expertise.
