Even better than analyzing documents is using AI chatbots to gather requirements directly. Instead of sending clients long forms to fill out, we can have them talk to an AI bot in natural language. The bot asks smart follow-up questions based on what the client says. For example, if a client says 'I need an e-commerce website,' the bot automatically asks about payment methods, shipping, inventory management, and so on. At the end of the conversation, we get a structured requirements document. I've used this approach with three clients this year, and it's amazing how much clearer the requirements become when clients can just talk naturally instead of filling out forms.
