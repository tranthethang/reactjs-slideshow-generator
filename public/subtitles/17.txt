Documentation is where AI really saves time. It generates code comments, API documentation, and even user guides automatically. For API documentation, it creates complete OpenAPI specifications from your code, including examples and error responses. For user guides, it can analyze your application flow and create step-by-step instructions. The documentation stays in sync with your code automatically. I used to spend 20% of my time writing documentation - now AI handles most of it, and I just review and refine. The quality is often better than what I would write manually because AI is more consistent and thorough.
