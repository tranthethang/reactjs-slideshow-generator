I'm Alex Tran, and I've been working with AI development tools for the past three months. We'll look at practical ways AI can help us in every stage of building software - from understanding what customers want to deploying the final product. This isn't about replacing developers, it's about making us more effective and productive.",

Instead of sending clients long forms to fill out, we can have them talk to an AI bot in natural language. The bot asks smart follow-up questions based on what the client says. For example, if a client says 'I need an e-commerce website,' the bot automatically asks about payment methods, shipping, inventory management, and so on. At the end of the conversation, we get a structured requirements document. I've used this approach with three clients this year, and it's amazing how much clearer the requirements become when clients can just talk naturally instead of filling out forms.",
